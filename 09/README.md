Completed Program is in the Square Altered folder

Game Description: The game starts by populating the screen with dots. The user is to navigate the square that starts in the upper left-hand corner to clear(run over) all of the dots on the screen within 50 "moves" or directional key-presses.

User instructions: Compile and run the program thorugh the VMEmulator as normal. When the screen appear to be static (done populating), use the arrow keys to direct the square's path. When the square is directed to go in a certain direction, it will continue in that direction until it hits a wall or it is redirected.
